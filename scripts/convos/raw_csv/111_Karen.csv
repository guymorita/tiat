girl,Hey! Haha not bad. You?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,I'm doing good. Finally Friday :)  Do you have anything fun going on this weekend?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
narrator,Great job starting off positive. Asking about the weekend gives a good opportunity for her to express something exciting and important to her. It's safe but also be aware that it's not the most original and that's ok. Normal is good in the beginning.,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,Yeah! Thank god it's the weekend! I went to drake last night and I'm hitting up weeknd tonight. You?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,

self,Are you around later this week? Do you want to grab coffee or something?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
narrator,Ouch she didn't answer your last message. Not a great sign but not the worst. Lots of people just don't check their messages very often. One way to handle this is to send a message that is interesting but doesn't include a question. Then it doesn't look bad if there's no response.,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
narrator,"This seems like a reasonable way to restart the conversation. If she doesn't respond to this let's move on. Persistence is great, spam isn't.",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,"Oh my goodness! I'm so so sorry, it's midterms this week so I've been super swamped with studying. I'm actually gonna be busy with school till Thursday and then headed down to SD for a music festival to celebrate end of midterms ‚úåÔ∏è Raincheck tho??",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
narrator,Looks like she just had a great weekend. She's giving an excuse which sounds legitimate and sounds like she's still keen to keep a connection. But hands off at the same time. Let's try keeping it positive and possibly try switching channels.,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Hahaha alright so I'm guessing you're really into live music,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,"And yeah, raincheck sounds fine. G'luck with your exams, and have a good time in SD :)",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,What's your #? I'll text your closer to next week to see when we're both free to meet up,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,Thanks! Hopefully I'm not totally brain dead after the festival lol. I'm 866-740-4531. Ping me whenever :),tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,"Haha sweet, I'll text you so you have my # too",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
branch,"Great, you can switch communication channels now. Maybe she will be more responsive via text. Didn't have time to bond but hopefully that can happen over text. This can be a little fast to ask for a number but at the same time whatever works.",tinder,0,a,terminal,success,,,,,
