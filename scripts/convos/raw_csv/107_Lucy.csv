self,Hello Lucy! Nice to meet you :) How is your week going?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
narrator,Simple opening but it can work fine. Shows that you're straight forward and inquisitive.,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,"Hi James, call me L instead ;) my week's over cause i'm back to work.. how was yours?",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Awwww,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,What do you do for work?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,Psychiatric technician.. ever heard of it?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,I have not! Can you explain? :),tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
narrator,"You normally need to be careful about asking about work. For a lot of people their job isn't that interesting to them. Quirky, or unique jobs like this one are an exception.",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,Basically it's like a nurse who specializes in mental and developmental behaviors...,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,That's really cool!!,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,"It's interesting, and dangerous..",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,What do you do?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,How so?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,I help companies grow :) Or at least try to haha,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
narrator,Good job here - using adjectives and verbs is much better than using a simple job title. You've opened the conversation up instead of creating a dead end.,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,"Well, the behaviors are interesting. Problem is, they're sick, or on medications which can make them unpredictable. One minute they'll be nice, and then the next minute, they're trying to hurt you.",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,Help companies grow?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Oh wow. Do you work on a psych ward?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Yes! Startups. I specialize in enterprise sales.,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,Right now i work with developmental disabilities.. i'm trying to get transferred to the state prison nearby..,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
narrator,Be careful when talking to people with stressful or difficult jobs. Dwelling too much might not be something they want to do in their time off or when they're using dating apps.,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,That must be very hard work,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,What got you interested in it?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,"Enterprise sales? Lol, it's like you're speaking a different language. You can explain, or i can pretend i understand? Lol..",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,"In the developmental, it's more medical, so it's less hectic",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,"But if i go to behavioral, then it'll be more challenging..",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,"We can just pretend ;). But seriously, it's pretty simple, I sell big projects to large companies.",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Lol,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,"I just found it interesting.. i don't know. When people hear developmental, they think learning disability, but they are actually very smart.. and the behaviors, it's like a guessing game..",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,I hope that all makes sense,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,Lol.. i get it!!,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Your job sounds much more interesting :),tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,"No, yours is.. you must talk to a lot of people all the time...",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
narrator,Job talk can be good but it can also be a bit bland and comfortable. There's a reason you never hear James Bond talk about his work and his job IS interesting. Let's move on to another topic...,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,I do haha,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Do you have a late shift? You're up late,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,"Yes, i'm on my shift right now. Doing an individual supervision. My patient's snoring away...",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,Why are you up?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Hahaha,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,I have insomnia,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,I'll try to go to bed again soon,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
narrator,"Dude, you're killing me here. Honesty is great but first interactions should be a bit more light and positive.",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,Really? That's tough..,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Yes mam,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,How was your night?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,Uneventful.. it was actually pretty quiet. Did you get to sleep well?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,That's good,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,I did eventually haha,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,How often do you come to the city?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
narrator,It's definitely helpful to find out if you're compatible when it comes to location. You don't want to invest a lot of time only to find out they live a 6 hour drive away.,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,"That's good. I can go to the city anytime, it's just that I don't like driving there.. lol.. people are crazy drivers over there..",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Hahaha,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Where do you live?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,American canyon,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,You're from the city then?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Cool,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Daly City,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Have you met anyone on tinder yet?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
narrator,The idea behind the question is fine but there are more artful ways to ask that create a fun and enjoyable vibe. Being too direct feels cold and uninteresting.,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,"To tell the truth, i've never done anything like this before! Lol",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,My friend was the one who introduced me to tinder so i just started here actually.. hahah,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,Have you?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Really? Haha. That's cool!,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,"Yeah, I've had the app since it came out, so I've met quite a few people over the years.",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,What's your experience been so far?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
narrator,Great job being honest and straight forward. It shows confidence.,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,I've met more jerks than actual nice people.. lol..,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,When did this app came out?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,What's your experience then?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Oh man! I'm sorry to hear that,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,3 years ago I believe,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,"It's been pretty good! A few weird situations where the person looked nothing like their pictures, but not usually haha",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,"Hahah! Seriously? See, that's what makes me feel nervous when meeting people.. i feel self conscious.. so exactly how many people you've met in real life from here?",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
narrator,"It might seem from her reaction that she liked your comment but rarely will you get an overtly negative response. The general tone here isn't building trust, comfort or happy vibes - just the opposite.",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Hahaha. You shouldn't be! You look very cute ðŸ˜Š,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Hmmmm. Maybe about 30 during the past 3 years?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
narrator,Typically giving numbers or getting into the weeds on details is not going to end well. A 'normal' number is very subjective and sounding too low or too high isn't going to help.,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,"Well you said, sometimes they don't look like their pictures.. what if i'm the same and i just don't know it? Hahaha...",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,30!? Seriously?? Both genders? Or just women??,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Hahaha. I'm sure that's not the case,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Add me on Facebook.,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,James Smith,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,"Hahaha. I'm straight, so just women",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,Lol.. hopefully not.. hahah...,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,But i barely use my facebook.. and there's some things in there i'd rather not have you see.. in case it turns you off.. hahaha!!,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
narrator,Sometimes it's easy to forget but you're trying to work out if you're into her just as much as she's trying to figure the same about you.,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Hahhaha,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,What would turn me off?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,I don't think that would happen lol,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Are you on Tinder looking for anything in particular? Just curious :),tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,"All the crazy stuff, the wacky pics.. hahaha.. the shared posts! Omg, just thinking about it makes me embarrassed.. lol!",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,"I honestly don't know why i'm on tinder.. lol. My friend downloaded the app for me just this last friday, because she enjoyed it. And she wanted me to try it.",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,"I can tell you what i'm not looking for.. casual hookups? Or being a third party.. Lol. Talking, dating's fine, if it becomes more than that then i'll tackle it when i get there..",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,"I'm open to anything, but i do have standards.. lol.",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,What about you?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
narrator,"Well that took an unexpected turn. She seems very open to self growth and experimentation, if that's what you're looking for then this may be worth exploring.",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,That's cool. I respect that,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,"Honestly, casual dating and meeting new people for fun. I'm not usually a one night stand type of guy, but I'm also not looking for a serious relationship.",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,"Lol.. exactly! I just want to have fun, and like i said, if it happens, it'll happen, then i'll probably just go along with it..",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Totally,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,"But I'm also not a Puritan, so if I'm dating someone we're hooking up haha",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,"Lol.. well, can't avoid that..",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
narrator,Looks like you're on the same page and there's some mutual interest. Nice.,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,ðŸ˜‰,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Hahhaha,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,I suppose not,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Are you on Instagram?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Want to add me there?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Or text?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,"Lol.. text or instagram are both fine.. but just so you know, i barely have anything on my instagram...",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,"Personally, i'm just not into social media..",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,(256) 333-5956,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,@lucytai1234567,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Well you'll have to text me pictures of you then haha,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,256.472.2841,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,ðŸ˜Š,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,Lol.. fine!,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Hahhaa,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,WaitingðŸ˜‰,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
branch,In the end it seems like it worked out even though it got bumpy in the middle. Lots to learn.,tinder,0,a,terminal,success,,,,,
