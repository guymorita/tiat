girl,"I do! I like those people the best who come in and say ""do whatever you want!"" It makes my life so easy",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,

self,"Nice! Well, if you want to, Add me on Facebook! Nick Raushenbush",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,How love have you been on tinder,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,

girl,I'm actually in zombie mode right now! Can we catch tomorrow?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,"Oh rad! What did you get? I always go into zombie mode after I get tattooed. Cool, talk to you ma√±ana.",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,I got some stuff done on my bicep that represents one of my favorite bible verses. I saw in one of your pics that you have a chest piece and some arm work. I'm a sucker. What are your tattoos of?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,"Very cool! Awww thanks. Yes, I actually have more work than is seen in my pics. Most of my tattoos are for my little brother and my mom. Unfortunately they both died. Are you a very religious person then?",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,OMG I'm so sorry to hear that. I would say I am but not the kind that shoves it down your throat,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Thank you. Well that's good! I think religion is great when people use it for positivity :),tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,Are you religious at all,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,I practice Buddhism. Are you Christian or Catholic?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,Christian,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Nice :),tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,How long have you been practicing Buddhism,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,5 years,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,"So what are your stances on everything? Homosexuality, Sex, Abortion? Right to the fun stuff ;)",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,"Wow lol. I don't think it's my place to judge when it comes to homosexuality or sex. I think above all else whether I agree or not, all that matters is that I love them. I have a lot of gay friends and family and it w",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,Would break my heart to tell them not to share their lives with someone,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,"But abortion is very hard for me to accept. I've had friends who have had abortions and I love them the same but I don't think abortion is fair. I think the only way I could maybe justify abortion is if having the baby means the mother would die but women are risking their lives all the time when they're pregnant. I think that most people are well aware of the possible consequences of having sex no matter how safe you and since you know then I don't think an unborn child should have to suffer because you ""aren't ready"". I believe that you should take responsibility of your actions",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,I agree with you on homosexuality and completely respect your view on abortion,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,"My opinion differs, but that's ok",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,And maybe rape could justify abortion but someone could adopt that baby. And some people will pay your medical bills to adopt your child so.... I dunno,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Thank you for your considerate responses :),tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,Lol either way my opinion is just that. It's not going to change what a person does but how I treat them makes a difference so I will just continue to love em,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Totally,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Dinner time ttyl,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Sorry I had to run to dinner with a friend. Thank you so much for sharing your views with me. I can tell you've put a lot of thought into them. I can definitely understand where you're coming from. I believe that a woman has the right to choose up until a certain point of development. It's more of a rights thing for me. But I can totally respect your view.,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,Oh yeah for sure! I wasn't sure if I just scared you off looking like a crazy conservatist or something. I mean I understand why people will do what they do but it just makes me sad lol because I think there are always other options,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,"Not at all. I think your opinion is actually pretty moderate for a Christian who is very religious. In light of the aforementioned, are you remaining abstinent until marriage?",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,Lol if you're asking if I'm a virgin I'm not. I waited for a long time and gave in. I still take sex very seriously. I don't think I could ever be a casual sex kinda person,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,"I think a lot of people are like that, religious or not. People can have very different feelings about sex. It can be a pretty deeply personal experience",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,What about birth control? What's your position on that?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,"Btw. I'm not trying to be pervy, I find this to be fascinating. I'm kind of like an anthropologist lol",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,I think it's good to take precautions but they can only go so far. Birth control isn't a hundred percent but hey why not. At least it's a preventable measure,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,Lol I definitely don't mind the questions,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,That makes sense :),tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,So what are you looking for in your love life these days?,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,Uhmmm that's a big one. Well I would want someone who shares the same values as me and who compliments me and who I compliment back lol. I want growth together and device to each other. I wanna kick it and have fun and laugh and cook lol,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,What a wonderful description! It sounds like you're looking for a soul mate :),tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,Well that's the plan one day.,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,What about you,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,"Same for me. I don't think anyone truly knows when they'll meet their soulmate(s), I suppose it just happens naturally.",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,"That being said, I'm pretty much just dating casually right now. That's how it's been for about a year, and I'm really happy :) Can't say I'm looking for anything or anyone specially, just enjoying meeting new people!",tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
girl,I love meeting new people and making friends. If it happens it happens. If not then not. Ain't no rush!,tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
self,Nice! :),tinder,0,a,,,,,,,
