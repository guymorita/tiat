{"type":"narrator","text":"Great job starting off positive. Asking about the weekend gives a good opportunity for her to express something exciting and important to her. It's safe but also be aware that it's not the most original and that's ok. Normal is good in the beginning.","platform":"tinder","wait_sec":"0","thread":"a","branch_type":"","terminal_type":"","next_thread":"","option_a_text":"","option_a_thread":"","option_b_text":"","option_b_thread":""},

{"type":"narrator","text":"Ouch she didn't answer your last message. Not a great sign but not the worst. Lots of people just don't check their messages very often. One way to handle this is to send a message that is interesting but doesn't include a question. Then it doesn't look bad if there's no response.","platform":"tinder","wait_sec":"0","thread":"a","branch_type":"","terminal_type":"","next_thread":"","option_a_text":"","option_a_thread":"","option_b_text":"","option_b_thread":""},

{"type":"narrator","text":"Looks like she just had a great weekend. She's giving an excuse which sounds legitimate and sounds like she's still keen to keep a connection. But hands off at the same time. Let's try keeping it positive and possibly try switching channels.","platform":"tinder","wait_sec":"0","thread":"a","branch_type":"","terminal_type":"","next_thread":"","option_a_text":"","option_a_thread":"","option_b_text":"","option_b_thread":""},

{"type":"branch","text":"Great, you can switch communication channels now. Maybe she will be more responsive via text. Didn't have time to bond but hopefully that can happen over text. This can be a little fast to ask for a number but at the same time whatever works.","platform":"tinder","wait_sec":"0","thread":"a","branch_type":"terminal","terminal_type":"success","next_thread":"","option_a_text":"","option_a_thread":"","option_b_text":"","option_b_thread":""}
